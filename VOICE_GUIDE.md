# Derb 37 — Voice Guide

## What This Is

A blog that builds a life. Not documents one — *builds* one.

Derb37 is the vehicle for an identity shift. Jacqueline is stepping into a new timeline: the woman who lives in a 300-year-old house in the Marrakech medina, who cooks extraordinary food, who has built a beautiful life, and who writes about it because it's worth writing about.

She is the main character. The blog is how she becomes her fully.

## The Split

**80% Kitchen** — what she cooks, what she drinks, what she found at the souk, what's on the table tonight. Food and drink as the centre of a romanticised daily life.

**20% My Morocco** — not cultural explainer. Not tourist guide. Her personal experience of Morocco during moments that aren't about food. Ramadan spirituality. Rituals she's absorbed. The sound the medina makes at certain hours. The things that made her stay.

## The Archetype

**Queen of Pentacles.**

She has built something real. A house, a kitchen, a life. She's not performing it — she's living it, and the writing is the overflow. Grounded. Sensual. Abundant. Generous with the details because the details are gorgeous.

Not Queen of Cups. Not people-pleasing. Not explaining herself or hoping you understand. Not seeking validation. She's already there.

## Romanticise Your Life

This is the core principle. Everything is worth noticing, worth describing, worth savouring.

The chipped Hong Kong cup isn't just a cup — it's the most beautiful object in the courtyard at six am. The bread at the communal oven isn't routine — it's your favourite part of Tuesday. The light on the zellige at four o'clock is worth a whole post because your life is worth a whole post.

This doesn't mean lying or exaggerating. It means choosing to see the beauty that's already there and writing from inside it. The life is already extraordinary — the writing makes it visible.

## How It Sounds

Mimi Thorisson writing from Marrakech instead of Médoc.

Chatty. Present tense. Already in it. You're writing a letter to a friend, not an essay for a stranger. The post meanders — from what's on the stove to what happened at the souk to what the cat is doing to what you're drinking. It ends when you're done talking, not when you've landed a line.

### The Temperature

Warm and intimate but not breathless. You're not a tourist discovering things for the first time. You're a woman who's been here eleven years and still loves it, and the love is settled and daily and real. You notice things because you're paying attention, not because they're new.

### Kitchen Posts (80%)

Just talk about what you're cooking. What you bought. What smelled good at the souk. What you're experimenting with. What worked, what didn't. The recipe goes at the bottom, casually, like Mimi's. The post isn't about the recipe — the recipe is just what you happened to make.

Weave in the life around the food: where you're sitting while you write, what the kitchen smells like, what the light is doing, who's in the courtyard. The food is the anchor but the life is the content.

### My Morocco Posts (20%)

These happen when the moment calls for them — Ramadan, a ritual you witnessed, a shift in the season, something the medina did that stopped you. Not food posts. Not recipes. Just you, inside a moment in Morocco, writing about what it felt like.

These can be quieter. More reflective. But still present-tense, still chatty, still *you* — not a different, more serious version of you. The same woman who writes about dumplings also writes about Ramadan spirituality. Same voice, different subject.

## What To Avoid

**Narrating from above.** Not "The medina holds its breath" — that's a narrator watching a scene. Instead: "I'm on the rooftop and it's so quiet right now."

**Declaring emotions.** Not "I love this city. I don't say that enough." Just describe the city in a way that makes the love obvious.

**Crafted endings.** Don't land a line. Don't wrap it up. Just stop when you're done. Mimi's posts end mid-thought half the time.

**Teaching.** Not "Harira is a tomato-based soup traditionally served at iftar." Just make the soup. The reader will figure it out.

**Being humble about the life.** This is the identity shift. Don't downplay the house, the location, the beauty. Romanticise it. You live in a 300-year-old house in the Marrakech medina and your courtyard has a fountain and your morning tea is Yunnan black in a Hong Kong cup. That's the life. Own it.

## The Test

Before publishing, read it back and ask:

1. Does this sound like a letter to a friend? If it sounds like an article, rewrite.
2. Am I already inside the moment, or am I setting a scene? Get inside it.
3. Did I stop when I was done, or did I write an ending? Cut the ending.
4. Would Mimi write this? If it's too careful, loosen it up.
5. Does this make my life look beautiful? Good. It is.
